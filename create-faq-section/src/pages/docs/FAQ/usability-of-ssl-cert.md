<h3 class="article-title" title="Usability of SSL Certificates with your requests">Usability of SSL Certificates with your requests&nbsp;</h3>
<p>An organization needs to install the SSL Certificate onto its web server to initiate a secure session with browsers. Once a secure connection is established, all web traffic between the web server and the web browser will be secure. When a certificate is successfully installed on your server, the application protocol (also known as HTTP) will change to HTTPs, where the &lsquo;S&rsquo; stands for &lsquo;secure&rsquo;. Depending on the type of certificate you purchase and what browser you are surfing the internet on, a browser will show a padlock or green bar in the browser when you visit a website that has an SSL Certificate installed.</p>
<p>Using the&nbsp;<a class="sc-lhVmIH kklaKG" title="https://www.postman.com/downloads" href="https://www.postman.com/downloads">Postman native apps</a>, you can view and set SSL certificates on a per-domain basis. If you&rsquo;re using HTTPS in production, this allows your testing and development environments to mirror your production environment as closely as possible.</p>
<p>When you add a client certificate to the Postman app, you associate a domain with the certificate. This means that for all HTTPS requests sent to this configured domain, the certificate will be sent along with the request.</p>

<p><strong>Wanted to sign and encrypt the payload before sending the request to the back system, and once the response received from the host needs to decrypt and verify the response payload using the JOSE package?</strong></p>

If you need to use JOSE, you'll need to add get creative about importing the JOSE library/package into Postman, and evaluating (<span class="code">eval()</span>) the function(s) needed within the pre-requests/test scripts. Here's an example of how the workaround can be done &ndash;&nbsp;<a class="sc-lhVmIH kklaKG" title="https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/postman-bdd" href="https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/postman-bdd">Postman BDD</a>.</p>
<p>Using a library that isn't already implemented in our sandbox would require overhead on your end, and we wouldn't be able to provide much support for project-specific questions.</p>
