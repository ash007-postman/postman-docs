### Launchpad

**Launchpad** allows first-time users to take a deep dive into the Postman environment, explore different features in the application. It also enhances the scope of new learnings for the existing users as they can go through unexplored features. 

The launchpad displays all the necessary features required to make the workflow easy, as it is more intuitive to view all the common requirements on one page. It's a one-click action to find out the multiple options rather than searching out multiple options individually.

New users can **Start Launchpad** as soon as they open the application. For existing Postman users, they need to close all the tabs and will get this option accessible.
